# Project Title: Activation Patterns of A2 Noradrenergic Neurons in Fear-Conditioned Rats

## Overview
This repository contains the R code and datasets for analyzing activation of A2 noradrenergic neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) of rats subjected to fear conditioning. The study focuses on dopamine Î²-hydroxylase (DbH) neurons, examining differences in activation under various conditions.

## Data Description
The data is derived from experimental observations on rat neuron activation under different environmental exposures, collected through specific methods. Key variables include:
- `Total_DbH`: Percentage of DbH activation.
- `Re_exposure`: Environmental condition ('Dark' or 'Home Cage').

## Files and Directories
- `DbH.csv`: Dataset with the experimental results.
- `analysis.R`: R script for statistical analysis and generating visualizations.

## Requirements
This project uses R with packages like `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `tidyr`. Install them using:
```bash
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr"))
```

## Usage 
To run the analysis:
1. Ensure that R and all required packages are installed.
2. Execute the script via command line:
   ```bash
   Rscript analysis.R
   ```

## Key Findings

### Statistical Significance
Our findings show a statistically significant higher activation of DbH neurons in the Dark group compared to the Home Cage group, with a p-value less than 0.0001. This indicates a strong association between the environmental exposure and neuron activation levels.

### Power Analysis
Our analysis demonstrated robust statistical power (0.899) to detect significant effects, supporting the reliability of our results. This high level of power ensures that the probability of a Type II error (failing to detect a true effect when one exists) is minimized.

## Descriptive Statistics and Roles in Neuron Activation

### Descriptive Statistics: Re-Exposure

### Regression Analysis
Here we present the regression analysis graphs showing the relationship of neuron activation with caudal, rostral, and AP areas.

## Regression Analysis Insights

### Predictive Roles
- **Caudal Region**: Identified as the strongest predictor of total neuron activation, emphasizing its crucial role in stress response regulation.
- **Rostral and AP Regions**: Although these regions have a less potent effect, they play critical roles in modulating stress and fear responses within the organism.

### Model Strength
Our regression model demonstrates a high explanatory power, with a Multiple R-squared value of 0.9774. This indicates that our model explains a significant portion of the variance in neuron activation among the studied subjects.

## Scientific and Practical Implications
These findings significantly enhance our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms involved in fear conditioning. The insights gained from this study have potential implications for developing targeted interventions that can modulate specific neuronal pathways involved in stress and fear responses. This could lead to more effective treatments for conditions linked to stress and anxiety disorders.
